Webapp for logging workouts based on Material Design Lite, Handlebars.js and Firebase. 



## Todo

* better name
* add support for running (any 2 or all 3 of distance, speed, time)
* graphs, includind trend lines 
* add weight coefficients to support e.g. Boring but Big and Wendler.
* body weight measurements
* warm-ups with ratios of first weight
* increments in reps for bodyweight exercises
* increments in time for static holds

## Anti-goals

* Deloading patterns. Complex to implement and IMHO just annoying.
